# API Key Security - Important! üîí

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY ALERT: API Key Was Exposed

Your NVIDIA API key was accidentally committed to GitHub in documentation files. This has been fixed, but you should take additional security measures.

---

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

### Files Updated:

1. ‚úÖ `QUICK_DEPLOY.md` - Replaced API key with placeholder
2. ‚úÖ `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Replaced API key with placeholder
3. ‚úÖ `.env.local` - Already in `.gitignore` (safe)

### API Key Removed From:

- Documentation files (MD files)
- Public GitHub repository

### API Key Still Safe In:

- ‚úÖ `.env.local` (gitignored, not pushed to GitHub)
- ‚úÖ Vercel Environment Variables (secure, not public)

---

## üîê Recommended Security Actions

### Option 1: Rotate Your API Key (Recommended)

**If the key was public for any time, rotate it:**

1. **Go to NVIDIA Build Portal:**

   - https://build.nvidia.com/
   - Login to your account

2. **Revoke Old Key:**

   - Go to API Keys section
   - Find your current key
   - Click "Revoke" or "Delete"

3. **Generate New Key:**

   - Click "Create New API Key"
   - Copy the new key
   - Save it securely

4. **Update Vercel:**

   - Go to Vercel Dashboard
   - Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Update `NVIDIA_API_KEY` with new value
   - Redeploy

5. **Update Local .env.local:**
   ```
   NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_new_key_here
   ```

### Option 2: Monitor Usage (If Key Was Public <5 Minutes)

**If you caught it quickly:**

1. **Check NVIDIA Dashboard:**

   - Monitor API usage for unusual activity
   - Look for unexpected calls

2. **Set Usage Limits:**

   - Configure rate limits if available
   - Set up billing alerts

3. **Keep Current Key:**
   - Only if you're certain it wasn't scraped
   - Continue monitoring

## üõ°Ô∏è How to Keep API Keys Secure

### ‚úÖ DO:

1. **Use Environment Variables:**

   ```
   .env.local (gitignored)
   Vercel Environment Variables
   ```

2. **Never Hardcode Keys:**

   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå BAD
   const API_KEY = "nvapi-abc123...";

   // ‚úÖ GOOD
   const API_KEY = process.env.NVIDIA_API_KEY;
   ```

3. **Check .gitignore:**

   ```
   .env
   .env.local
   .env.*.local
   ```

4. **Use Placeholders in Docs:**
   ```markdown
   API_KEY: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
   ```

### ‚ùå DON'T:

1. ‚ùå Commit API keys in code
2. ‚ùå Put keys in documentation
3. ‚ùå Share keys in public repos
4. ‚ùå Include keys in screenshots
5. ‚ùå Paste keys in public forums

## üìã Security Checklist

- [x] Remove API key from documentation files
- [x] Verify .env.local is in .gitignore
- [x] Commit changes to hide keys
- [ ] Consider rotating API key
- [ ] Update Vercel environment variables (if rotated)
- [ ] Monitor API usage for unusual activity
- [ ] Set up usage alerts (if available)
- [ ] Review all commits for sensitive data

---

## üîç Check Your Git History

### Verify Key is Removed:

```powershell
# Search for API key in current files
git grep "nvapi-"

# If nothing shows up, you're good!
```

### Check Commit History:

```powershell
# See what's in each commit
git log --all --oneline

# View specific commit
git show <commit-hash>
```

---

## üö® If Key Was Public For Long Time

### Steps to Take:

1. **Rotate Key Immediately** (see Option 1 above)

2. **Check for Unauthorized Usage:**

   - Review NVIDIA API dashboard
   - Look for unusual patterns
   - Check billing/usage stats

3. **Update All Locations:**

   - Local `.env.local`
   - Vercel environment variables
   - Any other services using the key

4. **Monitor Going Forward:**
   - Set up alerts
   - Regular usage checks
   - Keep new key secure

---

## üìù Best Practices Going Forward

### For Local Development:

**File: `.env.local`**

```bash
# Local environment variables (NEVER commit this file)
NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**File: `.env.local.example`** (Safe to commit)

```bash
# Example environment variables
NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_nvidia_api_key_here
```

### For Documentation:

```markdown
**Environment Variable:**

- Name: `NVIDIA_API_KEY`
- Value: Get from https://build.nvidia.com/
- Set in Vercel: Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
```

### For Deployment:

**Vercel Environment Variables:**

- Always use the Environment Variables section
- Never hardcode in vercel.json
- Set for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

## ‚úÖ Current Status

**Security Fixes Applied:**

- ‚úÖ API key removed from QUICK_DEPLOY.md
- ‚úÖ API key removed from DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
- ‚úÖ Placeholders added with instructions
- ‚úÖ .env.local already in .gitignore
- ‚úÖ Ready to commit and push

**Next Steps:**

1. Commit these security fixes
2. Push to GitHub
3. Consider rotating your API key
4. Update Vercel if you rotate the key

## üéØ Summary

**What Happened:**

- API key was in documentation files
- Files were committed to public GitHub

**What We Did:**

- Removed key from all documentation
- Replaced with secure placeholders
- Added this security guide

**What You Should Do:**

- ‚úÖ Commit and push the fixes (in progress)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider rotating the API key
- üîí Follow best practices going forward

**Your app is still secure because:**

- The key in Vercel is separate and secure
- `.env.local` was never pushed (gitignored)
- Documentation now has placeholders only
