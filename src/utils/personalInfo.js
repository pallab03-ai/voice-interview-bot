  lifeStory: `I'm Pallab Sar from India, and I recently completed my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) from Sister Nivedita University.
From a young age, I've been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems.
Over time, I developed a deep interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
I've built several AI projects, including plant disease detection systems and intelligent agents.
My ultimate goal is to become a skilled AI engineer who creates impactful and accessible AI solutions.`,

  superpower: `My superpower is persistence and problem-solving.
When I face challenges, I don't give up easilyâ€”I keep breaking the problem down until I find a solution.
This mindset helps me learn new technologies quickly and complete projects even outside my comfort zone.`,

  growthAreas: `The top three areas I want to grow in are: First, translating human expertise into AI agent logic - I want to master converting human playbooks like sales closing techniques or negotiation tactics into executable agent workflows. Right now I can build agents that follow rules, but I want to capture the nuance and intuition that expert humans have. Second, building production-ready AI at speed - I want to get better at shipping production-quality agents in days, not weeks, learning to make fast technical decisions, handle edge cases upfront, and maintain 95%+ reliability from day one. Third, system design for AI agent scalability - I want to strengthen my ability to architect systems that handle thousands of concurrent conversations while maintaining low latency and high reliability, moving from prototype to production-scale thinking.`,

  misconception: `People often think I'm not engaged or don't have opinions because I'm quiet in large meetings. But the reality is I'm processing information deeply and prefer to speak when I have something valuable to add rather than filling silence. I'm actually extremely opinionated and passionate - I just choose my moments. In small teams or 1-on-1s, I'm incredibly vocal and collaborative. I do my best thinking by listening first, then contributing solutions that have been well thought through.`,

  pushingBoundaries: `I push my boundaries through aggressive time constraints. I give myself 48 hours to build what would normally take two weeks. I do 'speed runs' where I try to learn and ship a feature faster than last time.

I've found that comfort breeds slowness. When I have 'plenty of time,' I overthink and over-engineer. When I have 2 days, I make fast decisions, ship, and iterate. That pressure forces me to develop better instincts and judgment.

I also keep a 'shipped' log - every project with date and hours spent. Watching that number grow and the hours shrink is how I track my growth. I'm competitive with myself.`,

  experience: `I have hands-on experience in AI/ML projects, including building plant disease detection systems with deep learning and integrating custom attention mechanisms like Dual Path Attention.

I've also worked on full-stack development, creating web apps that connect AI models with user-friendly interfaces.

Alongside that, I have experience with databases, backend development, and deployment pipelines, which helps me see projects end-to-end.`,

  why100x: `First, the mission resonates deeply with me. You're not building AI tools that make humans 10% more efficient - you're building AI agents that replace entire roles. That's the future I want to build. I've seen too many AI projects that are impressive demos but don't actually eliminate work. 100x is focused on true replacement, not just assistance, and that's the level of ambition I want to be part of.

Second, the culture is exactly what I've been looking for. 'Shipping is the only resume,' 'learn fast, decide faster,' working with people who want to grow 100x not 10% - these aren't just buzzwords, they're how I already operate. I've always been frustrated by environments that prioritize process over results, meetings over shipping, and comfort over growth. Reading your job description felt like finding my people.

Third, the problem space is technically fascinating. Building AI agents that negotiate, handle objections, close deals, and operate autonomously 24/7 with 95%+ success rates - that's an incredibly hard problem. You're translating human expertise like hostage negotiation tactics and sales playbooks into executable agent logic. That intersection of psychology, conversation design, and AI engineering is exactly where I want to deepen my skills.`,

    "AI-powered Web Applications",
    "Voice Interview Bot (this project!)"
  ],

  latestProject: `My most recent project is this Voice Interview Bot I built for the 100x application. It's a web-based chatbot that answers interview questions about me using voice and text input. I built it using React for the frontend, Web Speech API for voice recognition and text-to-speech, and NVIDIA NIM API with a 120B parameter model for generating responses. The bot supports multiple languages including English, Hindi, and Bengali. I deployed it on Vercel as a serverless application. What excited me most was shipping a production-ready AI agent in under 48 hours - from concept to deployed URL. The system prompt engineering was crucial to get 95%+ accuracy on answering questions about my background, and I optimized it with few-shot examples and specific response length guidelines. This project demonstrates my ability to ship fast, iterate quickly, and build AI agents that actually work in production.`
