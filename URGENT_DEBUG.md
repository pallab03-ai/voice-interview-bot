# URGENT: How to Debug Voice Issues

## Quick Test Page Created! üéØ

I've created a diagnostic page to quickly identify the problem:

### Access the Test Page:

**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/voice-test.html`

This page will:

1. ‚úÖ Show ALL available voices on your system
2. ‚úÖ Test English voice
3. ‚úÖ Test Hindi voice (if installed)
4. ‚úÖ Test Bengali voice (if installed)
5. ‚úÖ Show detailed logs of what's happening

## Step-by-Step Diagnosis:

### STEP 1: Open Test Page

1. Make sure your server is running: `npm start`
2. Open: `http://localhost:3000/voice-test.html`
3. The page will automatically list all voices

### STEP 2: Check the Results

**If you see:**

```
‚úì HINDI VOICES:
  ‚úì Microsoft Hemant - Hindi (India) [hi-IN]
```

**‚Üí Hindi is installed! ‚úÖ**

**If you see:**

```
‚ùå No Hindi voices found - INSTALL HINDI LANGUAGE PACK
```

**‚Üí Hindi is NOT installed! Need to install ‚ùå**

Same for Bengali.

### STEP 3: Test the Voices

1. Click "Test English Voice" - Should speak in English
2. Click "Test Hindi Voice" - Should speak in Hindi (if installed)
3. Click "Test Bengali Voice" - Should speak in Bengali (if installed)

### STEP 4: Install Missing Languages

**If Hindi or Bengali voices are missing:**

#### Windows 10/11:

1. Press `Win + I` (Settings)
2. Go to: **Time & Language** ‚Üí **Language & Region**
3. Click **"Add a language"**
4. Search for **"Hindi"** (or **"Bengali"**)
5. Select the language
6. Click **"Next"**
7. ‚úÖ Check **"Text-to-speech"**
8. ‚úÖ Check **"Speech recognition"** (optional)
9. Click **"Install"**
10. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for download
11. **Restart your browser** (important!)
12. Test again on voice-test.html
